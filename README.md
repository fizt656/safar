# Safar

Remember those text adventure games from the 80s? The ones where you'd type "go north" and hope you didn't get eaten by a grue? Well, strap in, because Safar is what happens when those games drink a gallon of cosmic coffee and gain sentience!

## 🌌 What in the Universe Is This?

Safar is the text adventure game you've been dreaming about since you first booted up your Commodore 64. It's like someone took the entire cosmos, shrunk it down to fit inside your CLI, and said, "Here, go nuts!"

With Safar, you can:

- 🌟 Watch stars being born (way cooler than watching paint dry)
- 🪐 Visit alien worlds (no green screen required)
- 🧬 Explore the quantum realm (it's like "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" but sciency)
- 🏙️ Witness historical events (time machine not included)
- 🚀 See future tech (still no flying cars, sorry)
- 🤔 Chat with AI (smarter than your old Magic 8-Ball)
- 🌋 Watch geology happen in real-time (more exciting than it sounds, we promise)
- 🌌 Travel through black holes (no spandex suit needed)

## 🖥️ Features That Would Blow Your 80s Mind

- **Infinite Universe**: More exploration possibilities than you can shake a joystick at
- **Actual Science**: Because "it's magic" is so 1985
- **AI-Generated Images**: For when words just aren't enough (eat your heart out, ASCII art!)
- **Immersive Audio**: Better than the *beep boop* of your old computer
- **Your Choices Matter**: Unlike that "Choose Your Own Adventure" book where all paths led to certain doom

## 🚀 Boarding the Cosmic Express

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fizt656/safar.git
   cd safar
   ```

2. Install the future:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your cosmic keys:
   - Rename `config_example.py` to `config.py`
   - Add your OpenRouter API key (it's like the secret code in your decoder ring)

4. Launch into the unknown:
   ```
   python safar.py
   ```

## 🕹️ How to Play (No Cartridge Blowing Required)

- **Explore**: Type whatever your heart desires. "Go north" is so passé. Try "Slingshot around a black hole" instead!
- **Interact**: Talk to aliens, poke quantum particles, or start an intergalactic dance-off. Your call.
- **Visualize**: Type 'visualize' to see what this cosmic madness looks like.
- **Rage Quit**: Just kidding, type 'quit' to exit (but why would you?).

## 🙏 Tip of the Space Helmet

- OpenRouter API for the brains
- Stable Diffusion for the beauty
- Every sci-fi author, mad scientist, and daydreamer who made us believe in the impossible

Remember, in Safar, "You have died of dysentery" is not a thing, but "You've accidentally created a universe in a petri dish" totally is. Happy exploring, you magnificent space cowboy! 🌠
