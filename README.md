# Safar

Remember those text adventure games from the 80s? The ones where you'd type "go north" and hope you didn't get eaten by a grue? Well, strap in, because Safar is what happens when those games drink a gallon of cosmic coffee and gain sentience!

## 🌌 What in the Universe Is This?

Safar is the text adventure game you've been dreaming about since you first booted up your Commodore 64. It's like someone took the entire cosmos, shrunk it down to fit inside your CLI, and said, "Here, go nuts!"

With Safar, you can:

- 🌟 Watch stars being born (way cooler than watching paint dry)
- 🪐 Visit alien worlds (no green screen required)
- 🧬 Explore the quantum realm (it's like "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" but sciency)
- 🏙️ Witness historical events (time machine not included)
- 🚀 See future tech (still no flying cars, sorry)
- 🤔 Chat with AI (smarter than your old Magic 8-Ball)
- 🌋 Watch geology happen in real-time (more exciting than it sounds, we promise)
- 🌌 Travel through black holes (no spandex suit needed)

## 🖥️ Features That Would Blow Your 80s Mind

- **Infinite Universe**: More exploration possibilities than you can shake a joystick at
- **Actual Science**: Because "it's magic" is so 1985
- **AI-Generated Images**: Now with options! Choose your flavor of reality-bending visuals
- **Immersive Audio**: Better than the *beep boop* of your old computer
- **Your Choices Matter**: Unlike that "Choose Your Own Adventure" book where all paths led to certain doom

## 🚀 Boarding the Cosmic Express

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/fizt656/safar.git
   cd safar
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (because we're not savages):
   ```
   python -m venv safar_env
   ```

3. Activate your shiny new environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     safar_env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source safar_env/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the future:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up your cosmic keys:
   - Get your OpenRouter API key (it's like the secret code in your decoder ring)
   - If you're feeling extra spicy, grab a Replicate API token too!
   - Don't worry about manually editing any config files. The script will ask for your API keys on first run!

6. Launch into the unknown:
   ```
   python safar.py
   ```
   - On first run, you'll be prompted to enter your API keys. They'll be safely stored for future adventures!
   - Choose your preferred image generation method: Replicate API for cloud-powered cosmic visions, or local Stable Diffusion for when you want to keep the hallucinations close to home.

7. To return to boring old reality (why would you?), deactivate the virtual environment:
   ```
   deactivate
   ```

## 🕹️ How to Play (No Cartridge Blowing Required)

- **Explore**: Type whatever your heart desires. "Go north" is so passé. Try "Slingshot around a black hole" instead!
- **Interact**: Talk to aliens, poke quantum particles, or start an intergalactic dance-off. Your call.
- **Visualize**: Type 'visualize' to see what this cosmic madness looks like.
- **Rage Quit**: Just kidding, type 'quit' to exit (but why would you?).

## 🎨 Choose Your Reality Painter

- **Replicate API**: For when you want your cosmic visions served fresh from the cloud. Perfect for those who like their realities with a side of internet.
- **Local Stable Diffusion**: Keep your hallucinations close to home. Ideal for the "I don't trust the cloud with my interdimensional travel plans" crowd.
